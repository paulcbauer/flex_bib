               News: The Politics of Disinformation? contains four main
               sections. In the first, we discuss the major sociopolitical
               factors that have allowed disinformation to flourish in recent
               years. Second, we review the very short history of
               disinformation research, devoting particular attention to two of
               its more extensively studied conceptual relatives: propaganda
               and misinformation. Third, we preview the seven articles in this
               issue, which we divide into two types: studies of disinformation
               content and of disinformation reception. We conclude by
               advancing a few suggestions for future disinformation research.",

               phenomenon, few studies have explored the role of digital media
               literacy shortfalls. Using data from preregistered survey
               experiments conducted around recent elections in the United
               States and India, we assess the effectiveness of an intervention
               modeled closely on the world's largest media literacy campaign,
               which provided ``tips'' on how to spot false news to people in
               14 countries. Our results indicate that exposure to this
               intervention reduced the perceived accuracy of both mainstream
               and false news headlines, but effects on the latter were
               significantly larger. As a result, the intervention improved
               discernment between mainstream and false news headlines among
               both a nationally representative sample in the United States (by
               26.5\%) and a highly educated online sample in India (by
               17.5\%). This increase in discernment remained measurable
               several weeks later in the United States (but not in India).

               respondents in a largely rural area of northern India, where

  abstract = "Social media have provided instrumental means of communication in
              many recent political protests. The efficiency of online networks
              in disseminating timely information has been praised by many
              commentators; at the same time, users are often derided as
              ``slacktivists'' because of the shallow commitment involved in
              clicking a forwarding button. Here we consider the role of these
              peripheral online participants, the immense majority of users who
              surround the small epicenter of protests, representing layers of
              diminishing online activity around the committed minority. We
              analyze three datasets tracking protest communication in
              different languages and political contexts through the social
              media platform Twitter and employ a network decomposition
              technique to examine their hierarchical structure. We provide
              consistent evidence that peripheral participants are critical in
              increasing the reach of protest messages and generating online
              content at levels that are comparable to core participants.
              Although committed minorities may constitute the heart of protest
              movements, our results suggest that their success in maximizing
              the number of online citizens exposed to protest messages
              depends, at least in part, on activating the critical periphery.
              Peripheral users are less active on a per capita basis, but their
              power lies in their numbers: their aggregate contribution to the
              spread of protest messages is comparable in magnitude to that of
              core participants. An analysis of two other datasets unrelated to
              mass protests strengthens our interpretation that core-periphery
              dynamics are characteristically important in the context of
              collective action events. Theoretical models of diffusion in
              social networks would benefit from increased attention to the
              role of peripheral nodes in the propagation of information and

               contract the flu from the flu vaccine. A nationally
               representative survey experiment was conducted to assess the

               to buy a used car from a car dealer. We distinguish between
               effects on trust of the past relation and the effects of the
               expected future relation between the buyer and the dealer. A
               buyer can learn about the trustworthiness of the dealer from
               past transactions of the dealer. Moreover, the buyer can control
               the dealer if the buyer and the dealer expect more transactions
               in the future, because the buyer may sanction the dealer if the
               dealer would act untrustworthy in the present transaction, for
               example, by refraining from future transactions. Temporal
               embeddedness facilitates learning and control through the
               bilateral relation of the buyer and the dealer, while network
               embeddedness facilitates learning and control through third
               parties. In the experiment, subjects are asked to compare
               different settings for buying a used car, while the relation
               between the buyer and dealer is varied in these settings. We

               primarily to ideologically congenial political information. To
               investigate this question, we link a representative survey of
               Americans with data from respondents? public Twitter accounts (N
               = 1,496). We then quantify the ideological distributions of

               validated estimates of user ideology with the full set of
               accounts followed by our survey respondents (N = 642,345) and
               the available tweets posted by those accounts (N ~ 1.2 billion).
               We study the extent to which liberals and conservatives
               encounter counter-attitudinal messages in two distinct ways: (a)

              people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or

              organizations that exhibited 95 to 98\% agreement on the
              classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther,
              faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories

In each batch, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 28 news-source mockups featuring a forged image, and they evaluated the credibility of the images based on several features. We found that participants' Internet skills, photo-editing experience, and social media use were significant predictors of image credibility evaluation, while most social and heuristic cues of online credibility (e.g. source trustworthiness, bandwagon, intermediary trustworthiness) had no significant impact.

An NFC × Media Skepticism interaction is hypothesized and tested on survey data (N = 424). Results provide evidence for such an interaction. For those with a reduced NFC, mainstream media skepticism is strongly associated with news exposure. As NFC increases, the association between news skepticism and exposure disappears. It is concluded that people consume news they do not trust when their media skepticism is irrelevant to their motivation for news exposure. Trust},

@article{Pettyetal1981,
abstract = {It was suggested that there are two basic routes to persuasion. One route is based on the thoughtful consideration of arguments central to the issue, whereas the other is based on peripheral cues in the persuasion situation. To test this view, undergraduates expressed their attitudes on an issue after exposure to a coun-terattitudinal advocacy containing either strong or weak arguments that ema-nated from a source of either high or low expertise. For some subjects, the communication was high in personal relevance, whereas for others it was low. Interactions of the personal relevance manipulation with the argument quality and expertise manipulations revealed that under high relevance, attitudes were influenced primarily by the quality of the arguments in the message, whereas under low relevance, attitudes were influenced primarily by the expertise of the source. This suggests that the personal relevance of an issue is one determinant of the route to persuasion that will be followed. In a recent review of the numerous ap-proaches to attitude change that have de-veloped over the past 35 years, Petty and Cacioppo (1981) suggested that these many approaches could be seen as proposing two distinct routes to persuasion. One, called the central route, views attitude change as re-sulting from a diligent consideration of issue-relevant arguments. The approaches that fall under this route have emphasized such fac-tors as the comprehension, learning, and re-tention of message arguments (e.g., Eagly, 1974; McGuire, 1968; Miller {\&} Campbell, 1959); the self-generation of arguments (e.g., The data reported here are based in part on a master's thesis conducted by the third author under the super-vision of the first two authors.

We investigate these issues in two studies that examine perceptual bias on a wide range of political topics spanning two decades. Using survey data as well as an experiment with diverse subjects, we demonstrate that people perceive the world in a manner consistent with their political views. The result is a selective pattern of learning in which partisans have higher levels of knowledge for facts that confirm their world view and lower levels of knowledge for facts that challenge them.

Interpersonal tmst is defined here as an expectancy held by an mdividual or a group that the word, promise, verbal or wntten statement of another individual or group can be relied upon. This definition clearly departs significandy from Enkson's (1953) broad use of the concept of basic trust which Enkson descnbes as a central ingredient m "the healthy personality "},

abstract = {SignificanceThe wide availability of user-provided content in online social media facilitates the aggregation of people around common interests, worldviews, and narratives. However, the World Wide Web is a fruitful environment for the massive diffusion of unverified rumors. In this work, using a massive quantitative analysis of Facebook, we show that information related to distinct narratives--conspiracy theories and scientific news--generates homogeneous and polarized communities (i.e., echo chambers) having similar information consumption patterns. Then, we derive a data-driven percolation model of rumor spreading that demonstrates that homogeneity and polarization are the main determinants for predicting cascades size. The wide availability of user-provided content in online social media facilitates the aggregation of people around common interests, worldviews, and narratives. However, the World Wide Web (WWW) also allows for the rapid dissemination of unsubstantiated rumors and conspiracy theories that often elicit rapid, large, but naive social responses such as the recent case of Jade Helm 15--where a simple military exercise turned out to be perceived as the beginning of a new civil war in the United States. In this work, we address the determinants governing misinformation spreading through a thorough quantitative analysis. In particular, we focus on how Facebook users consume information related to two distinct narratives: scientific and conspiracy news. We find that, although consumers of scientific and conspiracy stories present similar consumption patterns with respect to content, cascade dynamics differ. Selective exposure to content is the primary driver of content diffusion and generates the formation of homogeneous clusters, i.e., "echo chambers." Indeed, homogeneity appears to be the primary driver for the diffusion of contents and each echo chamber has its own cascade dynamics. Finally, we introduce a data-driven percolation model mimicking rumor spreading and we show that homogeneity and polarization are the main determinants for predicting cascades size.},

In this paper, we address the problem of evaluating the trustworthiness of a user in different types of Twitter graphs. We discuss this within the context of a persuasive recommender system that aims at creating personalized content using social media and other personal information. Twitter has been established as an alternative type of information resource due to its simplicity and its enormous number of users who transmit diverse information in real time. There is evidence that people are becoming increasingly reliant on others' opinion through their social network accounts. Trustable opinion is influential in persuading individuals to purchase products or support policy makers. The domain varies from consumer market to news and politics. Evaluating trust between two people is a delicate subject. In Twitter, neither the social graph nor structured data such as total number of likes or common retweets are sufficient to measure the trustworthiness of a user within a given social group. It is important to consider the actual sentiment associated with the tweets shared between the two parties. Existing approaches only consider relationships among users based on structured data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to calculate a trust score as a function of time and tweet sentiment.},

abstract = {Networked digital media present new challenges for people to locate information that they can trust. At the same time, societal reliance on information that is available solely or primarily via the Internet is increasing. This article discusses how and why digitally networked communication environments alter traditional notions of trust, and presents research that examines how information consumers make judgments about the credibility and accuracy of information they encounter online. Based on this research, the article focuses on the use of cognitive heuristics in credibility evaluation. Findings from recent studies are used to illustrate the types of cognitive heuristics that information consumers employ when determining what sources and information to trust online. The article concludes with an agenda for future research that is needed to better understand the role and influence of cognitive heuristics in credibility evaluation in computer-mediated communication contexts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{DiedenhofenMusch2017,
abstract = {Cheating threatens the validity of unproctored online achievement tests. To address this problem, we developed PageFocus, a JavaScript that detects when participants abandon test pages by switching to another window or browser tab. In a first study, we aimed at testing whether PageFocus could detect and prevent cheating. We asked 115 lab and 186 online participants to complete a knowledge test comprising items that were difficult to answer but easy to look up on the Internet. Half of the participants were invited to look up the solutions, which significantly increased their test scores. The PageFocus script detected test takers who abandoned the test page with very high sensitivity and specificity, and successfully reduced cheating by generating a popup message that asked participants not to cheat. In a second study, 510 online participants completed a knowledge test comprising items that could easily be looked up and a reasoning task involving matrices that were impossible to look up. In a first group, a performance-related monetary reward was promised to the top scorers; in a second group, participants took part in a lottery that provided performance-unrelated rewards; and in a third group, no incentive was offered. PageFocus revealed that participants cheated more when performance-related incentives were offered. As expected, however, this effect was limited to items that could easily be looked up. We recommend that PageFocus be routinely employed to detect and prevent cheating on online achievement tests. {\textcopyright} 2016 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

We concentrated on psychological factors that lead to the characteristic positive bias observed in many working social feedback systems on the Internet. We have used International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) and measured the following traits: trust, conformity, risk taking, need for cognition and intellect. Results suggest that trustworthiness and risk taking are factors clearly differentiating people with respect to tendency to overestimate, underestimate and judge accordingly websites' credibility. Intuitively people characterized by high general trust tend to be more generous in their credibility evaluations. On the other hand, people who are more willing to take risk, tend to be more critical of the Internet content. The latter indicates that high credibility evaluations are being treated as a default option, and lower ratings require special conditions. Other, more detailed psychological patterns related to websites' credibility evaluations are described in full paper.},

However, few studies have investigated what drives attention to content within the news feed and what influences the selection of news posts. We hypothesized that attitude consistency, the credibility of a source, and comments of other users raise interest in a news post in the news feed and influence the selection decision. A 2 × 2 × 2 laboratory experiment (N = 103) using eye-tracking measurement showed that attitude consistency did not influence attention distribution in the news feed, but users preferred to select news posts with content reinforcing their attitudes. Participants spent more time with news posts from sources with high credibility and selected them more frequently. Comments were not relevant for selection but were for attention within the news feed: If the news post and the comment did not share the same opinion, readers spent more time reading the content.},

For example, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say that the deficit rose during the Clinton administration; Democrats are more likely to say that inflation rose under Reagan. What remains unclear is whether such patterns reflect differing beliefs among partisans or instead reflect a desire to praise one party or criticize another. To shed light on this question, we develop a model of partisan survey response and report two experiments that are based on the model. The experiments show that small payments for correct and “don't know” responses sharply diminish the gap between Democrats and Republicans in responses to “partisan” factual questions. Our conclusion is that the apparent gulf in factual beliefs between members of different parties may be more illusory than real.},

We test this hypothesis using representative survey data drawn from 11 different countries with varying media systems. We further hypothesize that television will contribute more to cross-cutting exposure than newspapers. Finally, and most importantly, we test the hypothesis that the more the structure of a country's media system parallels that of its political parties, the more that country's population will be dominated by exposure to like-minded views via mass media. We find confirmation for all 3 of these hypotheses and discuss their implications for the role of mass media in providing exposure to cross-cutting political perspectives.},

We examine how messages of party conflict and cooperation affect public opinion regarding national security, as well as whether and how the reputations of media outlets matter. We develop a typology of partisan messages in the news, determining their likely effects based on the char- acteristics of the speaker, listener, news outlet, and message content. We hypothesize that criticism of a Republican president by his fellow partisan elites should be exceptionally damaging (especially on a conservative media outlet), while opposition party praise of the president should be the most helpful (especially on a liberal outlet). We test our hypotheses through an experiment and a national survey on attitudes regarding the Iraq War. The results show that credible communication (i.e., "costly" rhetoric harmful to a party) is more influential than "cheap talk" in moving public opinion. Ironically, news media outlets perceived as ideologically hostile can actually enhance the credibility of certain messages relative to "friendly" news sourc},

We conducted an experiment to probe two alternative answers: the “Science Comprehension Thesis” (SCT), which identifies defects in the public's knowledge and reasoning capacities as the source of such controversies; and the “Identity-protective Cognition Thesis” (ICT) which treats cultural conflict as disabling the faculties that members of the public use to make sense of decision-relevant science. In our experiment, we presented subjects with a difficult problem that turned on their ability to draw valid causal inferences from empirical data. As expected, subjects highest in Numeracy — a measure of the ability and disposition to make use of quantitative information — did substantially better than less numerate ones when the data were presented as results from a study of a new skin-rash treatment. Also as expected, subjects' responses became politically polarized — and even less accurate — when the same data were presented as results from the study of a gun-control ban. But contrary to the prediction of SCT, such polarization did not abate among subjects highest in Numeracy; instead, it increased. This outcome supported ICT, which predicted that more Numerate subjects would use their quantitative-reasoning capacity selectively to conform their interpretation of the data to the result most consistent with their political outlooks. We discuss the theoretical and practical significance of these findings.},

As a first step toward explaining this phenomenon, this study explores various factors that explain individual-level variation in media trust. One key factor appears to be trust in government, suggesting that the media's lowly stature may stem more from general political malaise than from the many shortcomings of contemporary news coverage. Interestingly, trust in the media is particularly low among conservative Republicans, especially those who listen to political talk radio. For these Americans, perhaps the problem with the media rests on what they see as a liberal bias, not declining journalistic standards.},

Increasingly, scholars are finding that citizens engage in motivated reasoning, whereby they discredit information that differs from their preexisting attitudes. The perceived credibility of opinion polls might be prone to similar motivational processes, as individuals could discount results suggesting that they hold minority opinions. We assess whether motivated reasoning influences the credibility of poll results and whether features of the presentation of those results might moderate and potentially counteract these motivational processes. In an online survey experiment conducted with a national sample of American adults (N = 1,211), respondents were exposed to poll reports about both gun control and abortion and were asked to rate the credibility of these polls. For each report, three aspects of presentation were randomized: the direction of the poll result (majority supports/opposes), the news source reporting the poll (FoxNews/MSNBC), and the amount of methodological detail reported (none/a lot). In line with theories of motivated reasoning, respondents who held issue positions that contradicted the results of the polls found those polls less credible. Further, this decreased credibility was particularly evident among individuals with high levels of political knowledge. Source credibility cues—such as the ideological alignment of source and respondent and the presence of a message from an unexpected source—did not moderate this relationship and were unrelated to poll credibility. However, evidence suggests that methodological disclosure could moderate the motivational biases in credibility assessments.},

This experiment investigates the influence of recommender characteristics (tie strength, political knowledge, political similarity) and different media sources (tabloids, legacy, and digital-born outlets) including multiple mediators (e.g., social pressure, outlet credibility) on incidental exposure to political news on Facebook. A 3 × 3 multi-stimulus, between-subject experiment with two additional quasi-factors and 135 different stimuli was conducted using a representative sample (N = 507). Results showed that strong ties and recommenders with high knowledge increase news exposure, but the impact of knowledge is limited to recommenders with similar political opinions. Similar effects occur for different media types, which also have an independent impact on news exposure. Structural equation modeling reveals that media source effects are mediated through media perceptions, whereas...},

abstract = {A democracy falters when most of its citizens are uninformed or misinformed, when misinformation affects political decisions and actions, or when political actors foment misinformation—the state of affairs the United States faces today, as this timely book makes painfully clear. In Do Facts Matter? Jennifer L. Hochschild and Katherine Levine Einstein start with Thomas Jefferson's ideal citizen, who knows and uses correct information to make policy or political choices. What, then, the authors ask, are the consequences if citizens are informed but do not act on their knowledge? More serious, what if they do act, but on incorrect information? Analyzing the use, nonuse, and misuse of facts in various cases—such as the call to impeach Bill Clinton, the response to global warming, Clarence Thomas's appointment to the Supreme Court, the case for invading Iraq, beliefs about Barack Obama's birthplace and religion, and the Affordable Care Act—Hochschild and Einstein argue persuasively that errors of commission (that is, acting on falsehoods) are even more troublesome than errors of omission. While citizens' inability or unwillingness to use the facts they know in their political decision making may be frustrating, their acquisition and use of incorrect “knowledge” pose a far greater threat to a democratic political system.Do Facts Matter? looks beyond individual citizens to the role that political elites play in informing, misinforming, and encouraging or discouraging the use of accurate or mistaken information or beliefs. Hochschild and Einstein show that if a well-informed electorate remains a crucial component of a successful democracy, the deliberate concealment of political facts poses its greatest threat.},

In view of the increasing popularity of Web surveys, this paper examines the limitations of this interviewing facility when measuring factual political knowledge. We show that Web surveys contain a source of measurement error as respondents can " Google " the correct answers. This cheating activity is our principal concern. Past efforts are extended by: (1) offering a self-reported estimate of the share of Googling cheaters, (2) showing that the positive effect of education on factual political knowledge is most probably underestimated when cheating occurs, and (3) showing that self-reported cheating activity is inversely related to actual response time. In the concluding section, we discuss the implications of these results and the extent to which cheating can be reduced. The empirical analyses are based on a Danish Web sample from 2012 (N = 1,509).},

Our results suggest that a source is necessary to correct misperceptions about the causes of the Zika virus on both Facebook and Twitter, but the mechanism by which such correction occurs differs across platforms.

False memory report frequency increased when false facts in a summary were supported by true information and varied inversely with the ease with which original facts could be remembered. Results from a measure probing participants' memory perceptions suggest that some false memories are authentic: People sometimes lack awareness of both the incorporation of false facts into their memory reports and where the false facts came from. However, many false memories are inauthentic: Despite reporting a false memory, people sometimes retain knowledge of the original stimulus and/or the origin of false facts.},

Results showed that people judge attitude-consistent and neutral news sources as more credible than attitude-challenging news sources, and although people experience slightly more cognitive dissonance when exposed to attitude-challenging news sources, overall dissonance levels were quite low. These results refute the cognitive dissonance explanation for selective exposure and suggest a new explanation that is based on credibility perceptions rather than psychological discomfort with attitude-challenging information.},

Some scholars argue that such technological changes increase exposure to diverse perspectives, while others worry they increase ideological segregation. We address the issue by examining web browsing histories for 50,000 U.S.-located users who regularly read online news. We find that social networks and search engines increase the mean ideological distance between individuals. However, somewhat counterintuitively, we also find these same channels increase an individual's exposure to material from his or her less preferred side of the political spectrum. Finally, we show that the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets, tempering the consequences—both positive and negative—of recent technological changes. We thus uncover evidence for both sides of the debate, while also finding that the magnitude of the e↵ects are relatively modest.},
