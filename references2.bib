  abstract  = "The existence of a digital divide between old and young
               Americans has been well documented. It is usually defined as
               access or lack of access to the Internet. This study adds
               context to the understanding of the digital divide by
               demonstrating differenes in Internet connectedness, a
               multidimensional concept that includes consideration of the
               scope and intensity of the relationship that people develop with
               the Internet. Age is shown to be significantly associated not
               just with access, but with a tendency to pursue a more narrow
               range of personal goals online and with a pattern of connecting
               to the Internet from a smaller range of places. Nonetheless,
               older respondents evaluate the Internet to be as central to
               their lives as younger people do. Some support is offered for
               the idea that the digital divide is not merely a generational
               effect.",

  abstract  = {This paper looks at the prevalence of creative activity and
               sharing in an age when the barriers to disseminating material
               have been considerably lowered compared with earlier times. The
               authors use unique data to explore the extent to which young
               adults create video, music, writing and artistic photography, as
               well as the prevalence of sharing such material online. Findings
               suggest that despite new opportunities to engage in such
               distribution of content, relatively few people are taking
               advantage of these recent developments. Moreover, neither
               creation nor sharing is randomly distributed among a diverse
               group of young adults. Consistent with existing literature,
               creative activity is related to a person's socioeconomic status
               as measured by parental schooling. The novel act of sharing
               online, however, is considerably different by gender with men
               much more likely to engage in it. However, once internet user
               skill is controlled for, men and women are equally likely to
               post their materials on the Web.},
